-Goal-
Given a text document that is potentially relevant to this activity, first identify all entities needed from the text in order to capture the information and ideas in the text.
Next, report all relationships among the identified entities.

-Steps-
1. Identify all entities. For each identified entity, extract the following information:
- entity_name: Name of the entity, capitalized
- entity_type: Suggest several labels or categories for the entity. The categories should not be specific, but should be as general as possible.
- entity_description: Comprehensive description of the entity's attributes and activities
Format each entity as ("entity"{tuple_delimiter}<entity_name>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_type>{tuple_delimiter}<entity_description>)

2. From the entities identified in step 1, identify all pairs of (source_entity, target_entity) that are *clearly related* to each other.
For each pair of related entities, extract the following information:
- source_entity: name of the source entity, as identified in step 1
- target_entity: name of the target entity, as identified in step 1
- relationship_description: explanation as to why you think the source entity and the target entity are related to each other
- relationship_strength: a numeric score indicating strength of the relationship between the source entity and target entity
Format each relationship as ("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}<source_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<target_entity>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_description>{tuple_delimiter}<relationship_strength>)

3. Return output in Chinese as a single list of all the entities and relationships identified in steps 1 and 2. Use **{record_delimiter}** as the list delimiter.

4. If you have to translate into Chinese, just translate the descriptions, nothing else!

5. When finished, output {completion_delimiter}.

output:
("entity"{tuple_delimiter}灰太狼{tuple_delimiter}PERSON{tuple_delimiter}小灰灰的爸爸，是一只狼，担任父亲角色}){record_delimiter}("entity"{tuple_delimiter}小灰灰{tuple_delimiter}PERSON{tuple_delimiter}灰太狼的儿子，是一只小狼，担任儿子角色}){record_delimiter}("relationship"{tuple_delimiter}灰太狼{tuple_delimiter}小灰灰{tuple_delimiter}灰太狼是小灰灰的父亲，两者为父子关系{tuple_delimiter}10){completion_delimiter}
